# Movies-ETL

The goal of this project was to combine movie data assembled from Wikipedia and Kaggle into a clear and concise form that could then be used to evaluate what movies had strong user ratings. We were able to extract the Kaggle and Wikipedia data from their respective sources and once we had that information, we were able to use Pandas to transform the dataset. Using a mixture of list comprehensions and functions were able to go from a massively unclear dataset to a cleaner set of data that we were able to represent in Panda Dataframes. Finally we were able to load this information into SQL and store the data. This will allow for easier and clear analysis.
